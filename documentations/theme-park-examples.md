- It loads relatively fast.
- They focus heavy on selling tickets at the landing webpage, there is virtually no other info.
- The navigation is conservative but easy to understand.
- When it comes to the entertainments, it is text oriented, there is no much visual represantion of the offerings (pictures, videos, etc)

#### Analysis

- Ticket selling is still emphasized on the landing page but it gives some more useful information than the previous one. It is easier to find important informations like, opening hours.
- Navigation is little more stylish, it has some basic effects. It is not well functioning, it is hard to click on the links but at least it is not too clustered, it is still easy to understand.
- It has some SM viewport adaption but overall it does not work well. Responsive design is only partially implemented.
